JGAMUT (written by Michael Birch, McMaster University) is a Java version of the old GAMUT code 
which produces an Adopted Levels, Gammas (ALG) dataset from all other input data sets.
 The purpose for such a code is - among others - to make producing an ALG dataset less labour-intensive 
 for evaluators and more standardized among evaluators. Included in the zip files are the source code, 
 executable jar file, user manual and example files. In addition, for those that work on any future 
 development of the code, there is a "javadoc" in the "dist" folder which provides detailed information 
 about the classes and methods defined in the source code. Instructions on how to install and use the code 
 can be found in the manual. Questions, comments and suggestions related to these 
codes should be sent to Michael Birch birchmd@mcmaster.ca with CC to Balraj Singh balraj@mcmaster.ca
